# Linear-Search-Algorithm-
This repository contains a simple C program implementing the linear search algorithm. Linear search is a basic searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached.

# Contents:
Linearsearch.c: Contains the C code for the linear search algorithm.
README.md: Provides an overview of the linear search algorithm and instructions on how to use the program.

# How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the linear_search.c file using any C compiler (e.g., gcc).
Run the compiled executable.
The program will prompt you to enter the element you want to search for.
It will then display whether the element is present in the array and its index if it exists.

# Feel free to contribute improvements or report any issues in the code. Happy coding
